1. why
	- After my undergraduate degree, I learned much more of what's possible and new topics to learn. Even though I had four years to learn all I could, it feels as if I'm still just touching the tip of the computer science ice burg. The reason I'm continuing for a masters degree is because I haven't had enough learning and want more.

2. what do I want to study
	- One of the main topics I want to focus on is in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence since that's the current frontier everyone is looking forward to. Plus I've always wanted to mess around with self made AI assistants, game NPCs, and use it for other data analysis projects. Of course I never had a chance to study operating systems and other topics related to computers on the hardware end that I wouldn't mind picking up. 

3. what do I want to get
	- The goal of the degree is to dip my feet into research through my thesis, figuring out if a PhD is for me. Either way I'd be satisfied with just the masters, but I don't want to be left wondering if there was something more I could do.

4. where do I want to be
	- When the dust settles and I've conquered this mountain as well, then I hope to be in industry gaining tons of practice in live systems and applications users interact with. This will help tie together everything I've learned and will allow me to learn more while pushing more engineering frontiers in the applications I build. Whether this happens or not, I'd like to make most of my impact in the academic scene by being an undergraduate professor, being the change I'd like to see. Having no guide to college as a first generation graduate, I want to help guide students to their best potential and have fun in the process. One of the greater joys I get is the pride I feel when a student starts to understand a topic or start running with an idea to learn more.
