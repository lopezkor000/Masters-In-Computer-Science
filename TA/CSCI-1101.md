## Course Description

An introduction to the breadth of the field of computer science. Topics include an introduction to computer science as a career, overviews of various computer science areas and topics, and foundations of computational problem solving.

## What Am I Bringing

My journey in my undergraduate degree was built on curiosity and determination to learn all I can about computers. Based on this, I hope to share with these students what it means to be a computer scientist and what their future holds if they decide to continue this path. The goal is to set them up for success with problem solving skills in computation, how to sell themselves for employment, and inform them of what specializations there are to pursue. I want to spark their curiosity as mine did my final year in high school.
